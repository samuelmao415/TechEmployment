This project aims to locate the ideal state for Wake Forest University MSBA students whose aim is to work for a tech company in roles such as Computer Programmer, Software Developer, and Computer System Analyst. The ideal state shall have at least one of the following:

a growing tech community (job growth)
afforable housing expenses(rent)
decent salary (competitive compensation)
ease of transporation (size of the airport)

The result from this project will help students from the program to choose which geographical location to start off their career.
