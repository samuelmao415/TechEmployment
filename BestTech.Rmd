## Introduction
###Project Objective

This project aims to locate the ideal state for MSBA students whose aim is to work for a tech company in roles such as Computer Programmer, Software Developer, and Computer System Analyst. The ideal state shall have at least one of the following:

* a growing tech community (job growth)
* afforable housing expenses(rent)
* decent salary (competitive compensation)
* ease of transporation (size of the airport)

The result from this project will help me to choose which geographical location to start off my career.

### Data Preparation

Data to support this project are from 1) [Occupational Employment Statisitcs](https://www.bls.gov/oes/) provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistic, where I can calculate and find the growth of tech jobs and avaerage salaries 2)  [ApartmentList](https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/rental-data) allows me to obtain average rent for cities in the United States (I will have to replicate the data since it is not downloadable) 3)[FAA](https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger) provides the frequency of enplanement of all the commerical airports in the US, which indicates the size of the airport.

The data I've found to support this project fulfill the criteria below:

- multilple data set
- non-normalized characteristics
- two or more datasets that need to be merged 
- variables that need to be created

### Methodology
The state for tech employment is derived from four metrics illustrated above. 

_Descriptive_: Job growth is the difference between last year's employment in roles such as Computer Sytem Analyst of a state (e.g. CA). Housing expense is the average rent of the state (e.g. CA). How affordable the housing expense is is derived from the difference between compensastion and the average rent. The compensation is the average made by a particular profession (e.g. Computer System Analyst) complied by the BLS. Frequency of commercial planes taking off is obtained from FAA, which allows me to explore the frequency of taking off of the corresponding state. Column graphs will help depicting the difference of the employment growth and the salary difference among states.

_Predictive_: forecasting the growth rate of tech industry of different cities using 4-yr moving average for the year of 2017 (since the statistics has not been released yet)

###Why Should You Care?
**Being in a state with growing tech community and wages is very beneficial to one's career.**

###State with salary and rent difference larger than $85000: CA CO DC MA MD MN NC NJ OR VA WA
```{r}
#difference >85000 and do more calculation
top_state<-rent_salary_comparison%>%
  filter(Difference>85000)
top_state
```

###The Ideal State After Taking Into Account of Airport: California leads with two large airports
```{r}

#CA CO DC MA MD MN NC NJ NY OR VA WA
#read data from the airport data
setwd("C:/Users/samuelmao/Desktop")
airport<-read_excel('R_Final_dataset/airport.xlsx')

airport_filtered<-airport%>%
  filter(ST%in% c('CA','CO','DC','MA','MD','MN','NC','NJ','NY','OR','VA','WA'))%>%
  rename(enplanements='CY 16 Enplanements')%>%
  arrange(desc(enplanements))%>%
  filter(enplanements>9000000)
 
#choose the state that has enplanements larger than 9000000 annually
airport_filtered
#we have these states left where we could obtain cheaper tickers (they all remained)
#CA NY CO WA NC NJ MN MA MD VA OR

###Conclusion:

* California is strong in two categories: salary and employment. It is the number one choice for people who want a good career in tech. Its employment number is almost double of the second higest tech employment state, Texas. The opportunite in California is plenty.

* Washington state is strong in salary, and it is growing fast. Although it does not have as many tech jobs as California, I believe it will be a strong contender in the next few years if the salary remains high and the difference between salary and rent remains high as well. 

* New York not surprisingly always a strong contender in every category. It is not different from Washington state in tech employment, salary, and the difference between rent and salary.

* Virginia and D.C.: Virgina is top 5 in tech employment and it pays pretty well. For people who are interested in working in tech for the government, the state is very attractive. D.C. does not have that many people employed in tech, probably because people who work in D.C. live in Virgina state.

* Texas: Altought Texas would not pay well in salary, and the difference between salary and rent is not as significant as many other states, Texas has the second-highest tech employment in the country. It can be a back-up state for tech since one could still be surrounded with a large tech community and benefit from it.

* Virgin Island: Due to its small amount of tech-employment, Virgin Island has the highest job growth rate from the past 4 years. Even it has only hundreds of tech employees, it is good to know that it is hiring, and the salary is the same as North and South Dakota.

>The Bottom Line:
Silicon Valley is still the tech capital, but Washington state is a good alternative. People who love New York can also find good tech employment in New York.
